There are three csvs for the MSA codes:

1. msa_and_state_codes_pre.csv
   1. This includes metro- and micro-politan areas as the US Census describes them.
2. msa_and_state_codes.csv
   1. This only includes metro-politan areas as the US Census describes them.
3. **msa_and_state_codes_bls_api.csv**   
   1. This features a few changes made the msa_and_state_codes.csv to ensure the msa and state codes match what is needed to access the data from the BLS (as some msa codes are different according to the BLS). 
   2. **Use this dataset's MSA codes when accessing data from the BLS.**
